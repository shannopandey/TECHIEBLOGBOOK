      <h1>Programming Language</h1> <br>
      <p>As we know, to communicate with a person, we need a specific language, similarly to communicate with computers, programmers also need a language is called Programming language.
</p> <br>
      <p> Before learning the programming language, let's understand what is language?</p>
<br><br>
      <h2>What is Language ?</h2> <br>
      <p>Language is a mode of communication that is used to <span> share ideas, opinions with each other</span>. For example, if we want to teach someone, we need a language that is understandable by both communicators.
</p> <br>

  <h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2><br>
    <p>A programming language is a <span> computer language </span> that is used by <span> (developers) to communicate with computers.</span> It is a set of instructions written in any specific language <span>( C, C++, Java, Python) </span>to perform a specific task.

    </p><br>
    <p>A programming language is mainly used to develop desktop applications, websites, and mobile applications.</p><br>

<h2>Types of Programming Language</h2>
<br>
<dl>
  <dt><h4> Low Level Language </h4>
    <dd><br>
      Low-level language is <span>machine-dependent (0s and 1s)</span> programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.
      <br><br> Low-level language is further divided into two parts - <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li><h4>Machine Language</h4></li> <br>
        <p> Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as <span> code or object code.</span> Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base 16) form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs.
<br><br>
          The advantage of machine language is that it helps the programmer to execute the programs faster than the high-level programming language.</p><br>
        <li><h4>Assembly Language</h4></li><br>
        <p> Assembly language (ASM) is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form. It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.
<br><br>
          The advantage of assembly language is that it requires less memory and less execution time to execute a program.
          
          </p>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  </dt>
<br>
<dt><h4>High-Level Programming Language</h4>
    <br>
    <dd> High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).
<br><br>
      The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.
   <br> <br>  
      High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.
   <br> <br>  
      A high-level language is further divided into three parts-
    <br><br>
  <ul>
    <h4><li>Procedural Oriented Programming Language</li></h4><br>
    <p> Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language is derived from structured programming and based upon the procedure call concept. It divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions.
<br><br>
      Procedural Oriented programming language is used by a software programmer to create a program that can be accomplished by using a programming editor like IDE, Adobe Dreamweaver, or Microsoft Visual Studio.
   <br><br>   
      The advantage of POP language is that it helps programmers to easily track the program flow and code can be reused in different parts of the program.
      
   <br><br>   
   Example: C, FORTRAN, Basic, Pascal, etc
   <br><br>
      </p>
    <h4><li>Object Oriented Programming Language</li></h4><br>
    <p> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language is based upon the objects. In this programming language, programs are divided into small parts called objects. It is used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to makes the program resusable, efficient, and easy-to-use.
<br><br>
      The main advantage of object-oriented programming is that OOP is faster and easier to execute, maintain, modify, as well as debug.</p>
      <br><br>
      Example: C++, Java, Python, C#.
      <br><br>
    <h4><li>Natural Language</li></h4><br>
    <p> Natural language is a part of human languages such as English, Russian, German, and Japanese. It is used by machines to understand, manipulate, and interpret human's language. It is used by developers to perform tasks such as translation, automatic summarization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and topic segmentation.
<br><br>
      The main advantage of natural language is that it helps users to ask questions in any subject and directly respond within seconds.</p>
